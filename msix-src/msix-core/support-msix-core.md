# Update your existing MSIX package to support MSIX Core

Before you can deploy your MSIX package with [MSIX Core](msixcore.md), you must first update your MSIX package manifest.

Apps packaged as MSIX must be compatible with the operating system in which they are being deployed. The MSIX package manifest must contain a proper **TargetDeviceFamily** with the name **MSIXCore.Desktop** and a **MinVersion** matching the operating system build number. Make sure to also include the relevant Windows 10, version 1709 and later entry as well so the app will deploy properly on operating systems that natively support MSIX.

The following example specifies Windows 7 SP1 as a minimum version:

```xml
  <Dependencies>
    <TargetDeviceFamily Name="MSIXCore.Desktop" MinVersion="6.1.7601.0" MaxVersionTested="10.0.10240.0" />
    <TargetDeviceFamily Name="Windows.Desktop" MinVersion="10.0.16299.0" MaxVersionTested="10.0.18362.0" />
  </Dependencies>
```

All **MSIXCore.Desktop** apps will deploy to Windows Server with Desktop Experience based operating systems with the same build number. If the app is intended only for a server operating system, specify a **TargetDeviceFamily** with the name **MSIXCore.Server**. Deployment to Windows Server Core is not supported.

## Update Manifest using the MSIX Packaging Tool 
If you have an MSIX package, you can use the MSIX Package Tool to update your package to support MSIX Core. Here are the steps: 
1. Open **MSIX Packaging Tool** app
2. Select **Package editor** 
3. Click on **Browse...** to locate your package
4. Click **Open package**
5. Under **Manifest file**, click **Open File**
6. You are viewing the package's manifest. Under **Dependency** add MSIX Core as a Target Device Family (see above)
7. Save and Close the manifest 
8. Re-sign the package 
9. Click **Save** and select whether you would like your package to increment
