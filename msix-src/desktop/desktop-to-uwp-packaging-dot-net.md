# Set up your desktop application for MSIX packaging in Visual Studio

You can use the **Windows Application Packaging Project** project in Visual Studio to generate a package for your desktop app. Then you can distribute your package to the Microsoft Store, on the Web, in your enterprise or any other distribution mechanism you're using.

## Required Visual Studio version and workload

The **Windows Application Packaging Project** project is available in the following versions of Visual Studio:

* Visual Studio 2019
* Visual Studio 2017 15.5 and later

To see the Windows Application Packaging Project template in the 'Add New Project' menu, you need to make sure you have **at least one** of the following the Visual Studio workloads installed:

* The 'Universal Windows Platform development' workload
* The Optional Component 'MSIX Packaging Tools' in the NET Core workload.
* The Optional Component 'MSIX Packaging Tools' in the .NET desktop development workload.

 For the best experience we recommend that you use the latest Visual Studio release.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The **Windows Application Packaging Project** project in Visual Studio is supported on Windows 10, version 1607, and later. It can only be used in projects that target Windows 10 Anniversary Update (10.0; Build 14393) or a later release.

Here are a few other things you can do from the Visual Studio Application Packaging Project:

:heavy_check_mark: Automatically generate visual assets.

:heavy_check_mark: Make changes to your manifest using a visual designer.

:heavy_check_mark: Generate your package or bundle using a wizard.

:heavy_check_mark: (If publishing to the Microsoft Store) Easily assign an identity to your application from a name that you've already reserved in [Partner Center](https://partner.microsoft.com/dashboard).


## Prepare your application

Review this guide before you begin creating a package for your application: [Prepare to package a desktop application](desktop-to-uwp-prepare.md).

## Setup the Windows Application Packaging Project in your solution

1. In Visual Studio, open the solution that contains your desktop application project.

2. Add a **Windows Application Packaging Project** project to your solution.

   You won't have to add any code to it. It's just there to generate a package for you. We'll refer to this project as the "packaging project".

3. Set the **Target Version** of this project to any version that you want, but make sure to set the **Minimum Version** to **Windows 10 Anniversary Update**.

4. In Solution Explorer, right-click the **Applications** folder under the packaging project and choose **Add Reference**.

5. Choose your desktop application project, and then choose the **OK** button.

   You can include multiple desktop applications in your package, but only one of them can start when users choose your app tile. In the **Applications** node, right-click the application that you want users to start when they choose the app's tile, and then choose **Set as Entry Point**.

6. Build the packaging project to ensure that no errors appear. If you receive errors, open **Configuration Manager** and ensure that your projects target the same platform.

7. Use the [Create App Packages](../package/packaging-uwp-apps.md) wizard to generate an MSIX package/bundle or an .msixupload/.appxupload file (for Store publishing to the Store).
