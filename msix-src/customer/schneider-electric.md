Schneider Electric develops GIS software to support both small and large utilities (electric, gas, water, fiber, coax) within the US and internationally.

In working with Microsoft, we wanted to bring our WPF applications to the latest installer technology, MSIX. We have a specific client-driven use case; we need to release and deploy frequently as a dev-ops minded software company, but each utility company wants to manage changes and individually determine what version of the application will be released to their users and when. We have been working closely with Microsoft to meet this customer requirement. After we complete our upgrade to MSIX we will be able to remove some 3rd party dependencies and be a step closer to updating our applications to .NET Core 3.0.

By leveraging MSIX, we are simplifying our development stack. We will be using Microsoft technologies from code (C#/WPF) to build (Azure Dev Ops) to installer (MSIX). One of the key benefits of MSIX is that developers can easily develop, debug and test the installer directly from Visual Studio. This greatly simplifies installation specific troubleshooting and has allowed us to work closely with Microsoft.

*"The support from Microsoft as we move to MSIX has been invaluable. We have a unique use case and Microsoft has helped us navigate any obstacles we encountered as we updated our applications. The developers are all excited to move our applications to MSIX."* –Darlene Rouleau from Schneider Electric
