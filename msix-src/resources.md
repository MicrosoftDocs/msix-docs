| [MSIX Toolkit](https://github.com/microsoft/MSIX-Toolkit) | The MSIX Toolkit is a collection of tools and scripts that help IT Pros and developers build and manage MSIX packages. The toolkit is an open source project on GitHub to allow customers and enthusiasts to contribute directly and provide suggestions and feedback on the content that is available. |
| [MSIX SDK](https://github.com/Microsoft/msix-packaging) | The MSIX SDK is an open source project that allows developers to use the MSIX package format universally on all platforms. This allows developers to build experiences which are consistent for users on all platforms and distribution methods. The SDK provides guidance for developers to package their app content and build an app package manifest in a way that it can target the platforms of their choice. This enables developers to package their app content once instead of having to package for each platform. |

The content found within the MSIX Labs can be customized and become the basis for internal training.
